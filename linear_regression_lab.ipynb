        "You might be wondering, \"*why all the excitement about linear regression?*\"  It so happens that regression is one of the workhorses of machine learning, and it also underlies other more complex types of models.  The advantage of regression models is that they are highly interpretable and very stable when it comes to training/fitting. In fact, linear regression models, particularly multiple linear regression with many input predictors, can mimic a lot of the power of more complex models, such as neural networks, while maintaining their computational stability and interpretability. There is a long running joke/meme about companies that claim to use \"machine learning\" actually use linear regression (and logistic regression, which we'll soon see more of). This isn't entirely a joke though since even if a company is using very powerful/complex types of models (e.g. deep neural networks), they will almost always have already tried using a linear regression model because it would be the cheaper and faster solution.  In other words, linear regression is almost always the default modeling approach, and is sometimes hard to beat!\n",
